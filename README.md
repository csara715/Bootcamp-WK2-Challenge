# My Portfolio


## User Story

```
AS A potential employee
I WANT to provide a potential employer my deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT They can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN A portfolia with a sample of my previous work
WHEN A potential employer loads my portfolio
THEN They are presented with the my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN They click one of the links in the navigation
THEN The UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN They click on the link to the section about my work
THEN The UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
WHEN They are presented with my first application
THEN That application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN They click on the images of the applications
THEN They are taken to that deployed application

THEN They are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
```
